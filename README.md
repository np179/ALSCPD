# Alternating Least Squares Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (ALSCPD)

This package is a student project providing different approaches for tensor decompositions. It can be pip-installed via the provided setup.py. Will potentially be updated further in the future. \
Provides out of the box acces to methods for decomposition of any provided tensor through the ALS.ALSclass.ALSCPD.run and ALS.ALSclass.ALSCPD.run2D functions and experimental acces to Monte-Carlo methods requiring acces to individual functions to calculate cuts through given tensor. \
May be updated with examples of how to use in .py or .ipynb in the future.
